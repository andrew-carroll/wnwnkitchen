## About us

We are an entirely volunteer-run charity dedicated to helping community help those in need. Our mission is to use community resources like volunteer labor, donated foods, goods, and monies to provide a free and wholesome hot meal every week in a family style atmosphere which creates a sense of welcome, belonging, and comfort for all. We aim to create a channel that facilitates the process of discerning the needs of individuals and families, and using the support of the community to meet those needs.
